Digital Earth Africa 

“Digital Earth Africa transforms how earth observations can be applied to address some of the current pressing challenges coming in the path of Developing Africa.”
Africa is a vast continent with a diverse environment, including various types of biodiversity and homes with one of the fastest growing populations in the world.  The population explosion is an additional strain on the natural resources in Africa, is also putting the environment under constant threat from climate change, environment degradation, natural calamities causing severe issues like food security and access to safe water- not only to the humans but also to the flora and fauna.
As a result, a new technological spirit is taking resolving these issues into hands but is hampered by the lack of actionable data. There are many types of data needed which are almost decision ready, for example rate of desertification, illegal mining activities locations, rate of poaching, total revenue from over agriculture, deforestation hotspots.
“Digital Earth Africa” will address this gap between innovative technologies and needed for actionable, structure, veritable data by using  analysis ready data produced by Satellites by leveraging The Landsat series of Earth Observation satellites, jointly led by USGS and NASA, which have been continuously acquiring images of the Earth’s land surface since 1972. 
Using this data, decision makers will be able to identify the common trends and patterns occurring in the given issue and thus identify the magnitude of the issue in the suture, thus combining Descriptive, Prescriptive, Predictive Data Analytics with DE Africa. Like we had earlier seen a use case with “Big Basket using AWS” getting insights about which products to keep in the shelf for a particular time, which stock to increase/ decrease, what marketing strategy to use - on parallel lines, DE will benefit the businesses at ground level as well- starting from Farmers -  who will not only rely on the knowledge passed on to them through generations but will also rely on the current trends and insights in agriculture, current diseases among crops, new products in agriculture which are leading to a better yield thus increasing profitability. Growth in small businesses is an equally important factor when considering a nation’s economic growth - mere industrial and technological development is never sufficient. 
Leveraging the achievement and lessons from Digital Earth Australia and Africa Regional Data Cube - Digital Earth Africa will make it easy to access critical information to shape the positive growth spanning across the entire continent. In conclusion, keeping Digital Earth as a model, it will help not only Africa but also underdeveloped, developing nations in choosing better paths, making better decisions and handpicking options benefiting the national priorities long term sustainability and economic growth.

Project Objectives:
1. As a part of this project, we are performing water body(of Africa) analysis using the “Water Observations from Space” dataset (WOfS). By water body analysis, we will try to understand and analyze water resources. This dataset is a collection of images from satellites, in which each pixel is classified based on a single measurement called “water”. Each pixel is either classified as dry pixel (water=0) or water pixel (water=128). 
2. As a part of our descriptive analysis, once the pixels are extracted, we will calculate the area per pixel and then the total area of water pixels. By this analysis over timestamp of each pixel recorded, we can  track how the water body area changes over time. By plotting a time series plot, we can identify the dates/months where there was more or less water within the area of interest. 


Future Scope:
As a next level of analysis, if we can get access to WOfS data of consecutive years, we would be able to do a predictive analysis and predict beforehand the drought prone areas in the coming months.
